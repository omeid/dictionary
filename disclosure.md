# Disclosure

`verb` disclose
`noun` disclosure

In privacy law, disclosure happens when you do any of the following with personal information:
- share it;
- publish it;
- make it accessible to others outside your organisation in a situation where you don't or can't control how they use it.

 Uninitentional disclosures still count as disclosures.
